# AlmaStudio

An unoffical Flutter application to replace the MyUnibo app.

This app was made for the Pratical Exam of the "Sicurezza Informatica - M" course at the University of Bologna, and is not affiliated with the university in any way.

## Getting Started

1. Install Flutter on your machine by following the instructions at [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

4. Build the project by running:

   ```bash
    flutter pub get
    flutter build linux
    # or
    flutter build apk
   ```

The web target is not supported, because of CORS issues with the Unibo APIs.
